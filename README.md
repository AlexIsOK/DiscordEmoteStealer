# steals Discord emotes you give it.  what else would it do?

while the bot does not require nitro, stealing emotes from other servers is only supported if you have nitro.

also: all files download as a GIF, though if they are not animated, discord will treat them as a normal image when uploaded to your server.

## usage:
after you rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and add your bot token, run the bot with `node index.js`.  you can then use the command `.st <emote1> <emote2> <emote3>...` which will
download the emotes into the `stolen_emotes` directory where `config.json` is.
